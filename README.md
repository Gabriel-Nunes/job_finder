To get it running on a linux server, launch the commands bellow:

    sudo chmod +x install.sh
    git clone https://github.com/Gabriel-Nunes/job_finder.git
    cd /job_finder
    ./install.sh
 
Now your jobs management system is suposed to be running on 127.0.0.1:8000.

Before using, you have to create a superuser. So open other terminal and run:
    
    docker-compose exec web_run bash
    python manage.py create superuser

#### Set your super user data.
Now whenever you want to launch the system you can just the following command on project directory:
 
    docker-compose up

#### You may also want to take a look at Django "admin" page at "0.0.0.0:8000".
